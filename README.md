# hello-world
This is my first git repository, and I'm making it as part of a tutorial for the same.

Ok, I'm supposed to write a bit about myself...

I'm Phil, I'm a postdoc in evodevo biology working on photoreceptor cell evolution. I used to be exclusively wetlab, and for the last 6 months have been making the journey to become someone who can look at scRNAseq data and use it to learn about cell type evolution. 

This project has led me to learn a lot of basic bioinformatics work, including learning R and Python and now, apparently, GitHub. I'm hoping I can continue to improve the way I'm doing my analyses so that (a) it gets faster and easier for me to expand on the analysees I have made, as well as to improve my own capabilities in data science and project management, which I hope to continue with going forward.

Wish me luck on my Git adventures!
